@!JTvister is a comic artist here who works on a series entitled https://jtvister.newgrounds.com/news/post/1231502[BONEMEAL]. Posting comics through the Art Portal is troublesome if someone wants to read your comics or if you want to update them. JTvister has made a guide to help comic artists out. They have also made an update with the assistance of @!Epithetsoup and @!The-Great-One. If you're a comic artist looking to add some structure to your comics for availability, then check this out.

=== @!FUNKbrs

FUNKbrs has been with the site since 2000 and a Supporter since 2016. A musician, former moderator, realist, and one of the kindest users on the site. Despite his many threads promoting hatred. He is a friend to many, those lucky enough to be called that. We thank you FUNKbrs for all the love you have given Newgrounds for over twenty years.

https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/365143

15 years ago, one of the most excruciating, random, difficult, and trolling games of all time debuted on Newgrounds. @!Splapp-me-do gave us The Impossible Quiz. If you want a game that will make you rage, then this is the one to bring your blood to a boil. I will give this tidbit to new players. Try not to use your Skips. That is all I will say.

{sp} +

**_"See how many questions you can answer before it's Game Over. Sounds simple? Think again... the questions are BASTARD hard and require obscure insane logic, super fast reactions or just pure luck to answer correctly.
It's not actually impossible though, just really really hard. GOOD LUCK! Mwahahah! :p"_**

Back in 2015, Tom Fulp wanted the forums to talk more about Newgrounds. @!Bit decided that we should share what we feel should be on the front page. From any portal on the site. A lot of great finds have been showcased on the front page of the site because of this thread. If you found something in the Portal that you liked, then share it in this thread. Tom may put it on the front page!
